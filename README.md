# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

 The purpose of this project is to adjust the current web app we created in this module to include all four of the hemisphere images. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then we stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
